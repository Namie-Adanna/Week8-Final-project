# Naly Cleaning Services - Technical Architecture

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

This document outlines the technical architecture and design decisions for the Naly Cleaning Services platform.

## 🎯 Architecture Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between frontend, backend, and database layers
2. **Scalability**: Designed to handle growing user base and feature expansion
3. **Security**: JWT authentication, input validation, and secure data handling
4. **Maintainability**: Clean code practices, modular structure, and comprehensive testing
5. **Performance**: Optimized queries, caching strategies, and efficient data flow

## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

```
User Interface (React)
        ↓
API Layer (Express.js)
        ↓
Business Logic (Controllers)
        ↓
Data Access Layer (Mongoose)
        ↓
Database (MongoDB)
```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers/logs in with credentials
2. Server validates credentials and generates JWT token
3. Token is stored in client (localStorage/httpOnly cookie)
4. Protected routes verify token on each request
5. Token includes user role for authorization

## 📊 Database Relationships

```
Users (1) ←→ (Many) Bookings
Services (1) ←→ (Many) Bookings
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token expiration and refresh strategy
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CORS configuration
- Environment variable protection

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Frontend: Vite dev server (localhost:5173)
- Backend: Express server (localhost:5000)
- Database: Local MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas

### Production Environment
- Frontend: Static files on Netlify/Vercel
- Backend: Node.js server on Render/Railway
- Database: MongoDB Atlas cluster
- CDN: For static assets and images

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- API response caching where appropriate
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Code splitting and bundle optimization
- Pagination for large data sets

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for critical endpoints

## 📦 Package Management

Using pnpm for faster installs and better dependency management:
- Shared dependencies across workspaces
- Strict dependency resolution
- Efficient disk space usage

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

1. Code push triggers GitHub Actions
2. Run automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)
3. Build frontend and backend
4. Deploy to staging environment
5. Run smoke tests
6. Deploy to production (manual approval)

## 📝 API Design Principles

- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- Consistent response format
- Proper error handling and status codes
- API versioning strategy
- Request/response validation
- Comprehensive API documentation

## 🎨 Frontend Architecture

- Component-based architecture with React
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Context API for global state management
- Atomic design principles for UI components
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## 🔧 Development Tools

- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier
- **Type Safety**: PropTypes or TypeScript (optional)
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits
